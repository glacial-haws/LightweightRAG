Lightweight Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Contract Question-Answering on Local Hardware

This is the repo for publication. It is not the main repo for development. It contains only the code necessary to run the experiments (folder cbfk/)and generate the results reported in the paper (folder insights/). Because of the proprietary nature of the corpus, the data and the experiment artefacts are not included in this repo. Also not included are test modules, deployment scripts, etc. to mitigate the risk of accidental disclosure of sensitive information.
